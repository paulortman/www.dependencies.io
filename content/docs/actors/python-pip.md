A [dependencies.io](https://www.dependencies.io)
[actor](https://www.dependencies.io/docs/actors/) that updates python pip
dependencies listed in requirements.txt files using git branches and pull requests.

## Usage

For the dependency.path, does a basic replacement of `{name}=={installed}` to
`{name}=={new_version}`. **You must (and should anyway) be pinning the exact
version of your dependencies for this to work.** If given a `pip_freeze_target`,
then also does a fresh `pip install -r` and `pip freeze` to a specified path to
save all dependency versions.

For each dependency, it will get the **highest** version and create a single
branch/PR that updates all the way to that version (skipping/including any
versions in between).

### .dependencies.yml

```yaml
collectors:
- ...
  actors:
  - type: python-pip
    versions: "L.Y.Y"
    settings:  # all settings are optional
      pip_freeze_target: path/to/frozen/requirements.txt  # path to `pip freeze > path`
      pr_labels:  # list of label names
      - bug
      pr_assignees:  # list of usernames
      - davegaeddert
      pr_milestone: 3  # milestone number
```

### Works well with

- [python-pip collector](https://www.dependencies.io/docs/collectors/python-pip/) ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/dependencies-io/collector-python-pip/))
